Data Science Project Topic – Predicting People’s Mood Based On Current Events
ReadMe File - 

This project is a modification of sentiment analysis, where the goal is to identify or predict the possible mood of a person or an individual when reading or viewing a particular event either in social media platforms and news channels.
Aim – The aim of the project is to provide better insight into the moods the people will feel when reading a particular article or news either on real-time broadcast or social media.
Scope – Since the scope and variety of real-time news and content on social media is vast, this project aims to tailor down to the most crucial types of news such as geopolitical news relating to US (United States) and EU (European Union) and entertainment news related to Western music and Hollywood.
Language Of Content – Since, this project focuses on sentiment analysis and uses NLP tools, for ease of training the model, we are limiting all the textual content to English language. This textual content will include data from news articles, blogs, and public comments from social media platform Twitter.

Possible Outcomes We Plan To Achieve –
1)	For the model to have the ability to affectively parse through the pre-existing textual articles and blogposts and predict a general mood of the content.
2)	To detect negative mood based on keywords and hate speech
3)	To monitor public sentiment regarding sensitive news materials
4)	To visualize trends in people’s moods and compare between different types of news namely geopolitical news and entertainment news.
5)	To deduce or predict which type of news affects people’s moods the most.

Possible Applications Of The Project–
1)	This analysis will provide a better insight for marketing companies, and news channels to make the articles or news more engaging, to frame the news or piece of information more clearly and concisely to attract maximum target audience.
2)	The project can assist policy makers in creating stringent policies when it comes to circulating news related to sensitive matter or geopolitical content.

Data Collection For The Project –
We aim to collect data for the project in two phases, one having primary data including surveys and questionnaires targeting public and young adults and recording their sentiments on past events or most relevant information. We are going to collect data from individuals of age group 20-30, and will have a sample size of approximately 200 to 300 individuals. The secondary data will refer to data being collected from two distinct news channels namely “New York Times” and “CNN” and one social media platform “Twitter” by using their open-source API and this data will be used to train the model or different parameters to predict the mood and will use extensive NLP techniques to increase efficiency of the model. The testing data for this model will comprise of an unknown news channel “ABC News” and one unused social media or blog platform such as “Reddit” only.
